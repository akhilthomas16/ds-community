            "description": "Just like other books of Headfirst, the tone of this book is friendly and conversational and the best book for data science to start with. The book covers a lot of statistics starting with descriptive statistics – mean, median, mode, standard deviation – and then go on to probability and inferential statistics like correlation, regression, etc… If you were a science or commerce student in school, you may have studied all of it, and the book is a great start to refresh everything you have already learned in a detailed manner.",

            "description": "Logging is a very useful tool in a programmer’s toolbox. It can help you develop a better understanding of the flow of a program and discover scenarios that you might not even have thought of while developing.\r\n\r\nLogs provide developers with an extra set of eyes that are constantly looking at the flow that an application is going through. They can store information, like which user or IP accessed the application. If an error occurs, then they can provide more insights than a stack trace by telling you what the state of the program was before it arrived at the line of code where the error occurred.",
